            <h2>Network Diagrams</h2><br>
            <p>A Network diagram is a visual representation of a computer or telecommunications network.
                It shows the components that make up a network and how they interact, including routers, devices,
                hubs, firewalls, etc. This network diagram shows a local area network (LAN):
                Depending on its scope and purpose, a network diagram may contain lots of detail or just provide
                a broad overview. For instance, a diagram of a LAN might could show the IP addresses of individual
                computers, while the diagram of a MAN (metropolitan area network) could represent buildings or areas
                with a single node.

            </div>
            <p>A network diagram can be either physical or logical</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Logical Network diagrams</h2>
            <p>A logical network diagram decribes the way information flows through a network. Therefore, logical diagrams typically
                show subnets (includeing VLAN IDs, Masks, Addresses).Network devices like Routers, Firewalls, and routing protocols.
            </p>

            <p>In the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, logical network diagrams correlate with the information contained
                in layer 3 (L3). Also known as the “network layer,” L3 is an abstraction layer that deals with packet forwarding
                through intermediate routers. Level 2 shows the data links between adjacent nodes, while level 1 shows the purely
                physical layout.

        <div>
            <h2>Physical Network diagrams</h2>
            <p>A physical network disgram shows the actual phuysical arrangement of the components that make up the network,
                including cables and hardware. Typically, the diagram gives a birds eye view of the network in its physical
                space like a floor plan.

            <h3>How are network diagrams used?</h3>
            <p>With the capacity for showing network components interact, network diagrams can serve a veirity of purposes, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Planning the structure of a home or professional network</li>
                <li>Cordinating updates to an existing network</li>
                <li>Reporting and troubleshooting network problems</li>
                <li>To Comply to PCI or other requirements</li>
                <li>As Documentation for external communication, or onboarding etc</li>
                <li>To keep track of components</li>
                <li>Sending relivant information to a vendor for a RFP (request for proposal) without disclosing confidential information</li>
                <li>Selling a relivant proposal to finacial stakeholders</li>
                <li>Proposing high level, syslog infrastructure changes</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>What is network topology?</h3>
        <p>Network topology refers to the arrangment of elements in a network. Like Network diagrams, Network topologies
            can describe either a physical or logical aspects of a network. Logical topology can also be refered to as
            signal topology.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Bus Topology</h2>
        <p>Also known as backbone, linear, or ethernet topology, this type of network is distiguished for having all of
            the nodes connected by a central medium. The "bus" which has exactly 2 end points.
        </p>
        <p>Bus topologies are easy to configure and require less cable length than some other topologies.
            However if the central bus breaks down, so does the whole network, and it can be dificult to isolate the problem 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Ring Topology</h2>
        <p>Nodes are connected in a circular configuation, and packets of information are sent through the ring until
            they reach there destination. Ring topology can outperform those based on the bus topology, and they can 
            easily be reconfiguired to add or remove devices. However, they are still relively vulnerable, since the
            whole network fails if a single network fails. Also, bandwidth must be shared accross all the devices
            and connection.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Star Topology</h2>
        <p>One of the most common topologies, the Star topology consists of a central hub or switch, through which all of
            the data passes. Along with all the peripheral nodes connected to that central node.
                Star topology tends to be reliable because individual machines may crash without affecting the rest of the
            network. But if the central hub or switch fails, none of the connected nodes will be able to access it.
            Cable cost tend to be higher aswell.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Mesh Topology</h2>
        <p>There are two types of mesh topologies. In the first, which is called full mesh topologies, each node
            is directly connected to every other node.</p>
        <p>In a partial mesh topology, nodes are only connected to the nodes they connect with the most</p>
        <p>Most Networks employ some combination of the topologies to yeild whats called a HYBRID typology 
            For example, the TREE topology is a combination of the bus and mesh topologies.
        </p>
        <p>The logical and physical topology of a particular network may resemble one another, or
            they may be entirely different. For example a twitsted pair ethernet network exists
            as a star topology physicaly but follows the bus topology logically.
        </p>
    </div>

        <h1>Network diagram examples</h1>
        <p>Network diagrams can be used to represent virtually any Network, which means there is alot of variety.
            Network diagrams vary in two important ways: by the type of network they represent and by network topology,
            or the arrangments of the componenets.
        </p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div>
            <h2>Virtual Private Network</h2>
            <p>Allows users to access a private network over a public network as they are directly connected to the private network</p>

            <h2>Server Rack</h2>
            <p>Shows the layout of the rack system</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Enterprise Private Network</h2>
            <p>Connects diverse elements within a business, such as multiple sites</p>
        </div>

            <p>Shows how information is relayed over telephone lines</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>Network Diagram symbols</h1>
        <p>Since a network diagram is a visual representation of an actual system, it relies on symbols to convey meaning.
            Some symbols represent actual physical entities, While others represent the kinds of relationships that 
            exist between entities.</p>

                <h2>Cisco, AWS, GCP, and Azure symbols</h2>
                <p>Cisco INC is one of the largest providers of networking equipment in the world.
                    As such they have to develope a comprehensive set of network topology icons that correspond
                    with the equipment they offer. Cisco Advanced Services Team helps organizations optimize their
                    networks for maximium uptime. These icons offer a clear convienent way to communicate about
                    those networks.

                    cloud hosting services, also have there own set of symbols and icons describing networks hosted on
