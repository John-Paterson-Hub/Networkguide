            <h3>Routers</h3>
            <p>Routers are a device like a switch that route data packets based on the IP addresses.
                The router is mainly a Network layrer device. Routers normally connect LANs and WANs.
                and have dynamically updating routing table based on which they make decisions on routing
                the data packets.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Layer 2 and Layer 3 switches</h3>
            <p>Layer 2 switches offer limited to no routing capabilities within network
                segements such as VLANs. Layer 3 switches offer routing between deiffernt
                network segments. Limited scalablity. Higher scalablity enabledby layer 3
                switches cross segmented routing routing capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Layer 2 known as the data link layer provides node-to-node data wiht MAC address verification.
                All nodes on layer 2 are visible to one another. Ethernet is a common layer 2 example. Layer 3
                known as the network layer routes data packets to specific nodes identified by IP.

            <h3>
                Next generation firewall and IPS
            </h3>
            <p>Next generation firewall and IPS can monitor for potentialy malicious activity based on specific behavior
                signatures
                or anomalies and block suspicious trafic from the network. These capabilities are referred to as
                Intrusion
                detection
                services (IDS) and Itrusion Provention Services (IPS).

            <h3>Access points</h3>
            <p>An Access point is a device that acts as a portal for devices to connect to a local area network.
                A device that creates a local area network or WLAN ussally for an office or a building.
                Three types of Access points Standalone, Multifunction, and client.
                A Standalone access point works in a wireless network exactly as a switch works in a wired network.
                To control the unauthorized access, Access point uses authurization.
                Access points connect multiply wireless devices together in a single network.
                Access points support both Ethernet and WIFI.
                Access points use radio signal to provide the conectivity

            <h3>Controllers (Cisco DNA and WLC)</h3>
            <p>DNA centers simplify network management, lower costs, and incorporate cloud services and third party
                integrations.
                WLC stand for wireless LAN Controller, which is used to manage many access points.
                A network component that manages access points and allows wireless devices to connect to the network.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Endpoints</h3>
            <p>In simple words an endpoint device networking is any hardware which can access the network resources.
                The hardware mayh be Server, computer, Laptop, Smartphone, Scanner, printer etc. The main purpose is to
                share recources avaliable in the network. Physical devices that connect and exchange information with a
                computer network.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Servers</h3>
            <p>Network Server is used to manage network recources such as controlling access to a network,
                sending/reciving
                emails,
                or hosting websites or so on.Servers also offer advanced functions like remote access monitoring, and
                cloud
                management
                and so on.

            <h3>PoE</h3>
            <p>Power over Ethernet (PoE) transport short haul (Up to 100 meters) DC Power across Ethernet Cables
                between Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) and Powered devies (PDs). PoE is a technique for delivering power
                to
                devices over
                copper Ethernet Cabling, eliminating the need for seperate power supplies and outlets. While PoE doesnt
                add
                Ethernet
                data capabilities, it does expand options for how and where Ethernet end devices can be placed.

        <h1>Describe Charateristics of network Topology Architectures </h1>
        <div>
            <div>
                <h3>Two-tier</h3>
                <p>Access layer connects the endpoints such as servers, workstations, and other network devices, while the core layer
                    handles traffic routing and distribution. This Architecture is common in small to medium sized networks
                    with limited traffic and devices.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Three-tier</h3>
                <p>Traditional data center networks utilized a three tier design that consists of a core, distribution, 
                    and access layer of switches. Core switches are usally large modular chassis with high throughput
                    and advanced routing capabilities.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Spine-Leaf</h3>
                <p>Architecture is data  center network topology that consists of two switching layers -a spine and leaf.
                    The leaf layer consists of access switches that aggregate traffic from servers and connects
                    directly into the spine or network core. Spine switches interconnect all leaf switches in a full mesh topology.
                </p>

            <div>
                <h3>WAN</h3>
                <p>WAN consists of three points router, switch, and modem. Routers connect LAN to WAN. Routers
                    handles routing messages between the network.
                    Switch is a network device that selects the curcuit or path for sending the data to 
                    its destination.
                    Modem is a short form modulator / demodulator. It eneables the computers to cummunicate
                    using telephone lines. the signal will be covered from digital signal to analog and 
                    visa versa for reciving and transmission.
                    Wide Area Network (WAN), is a large network of information that is not tied to a single location.

                <h3>On-premise and cloud</h3>
                <p>On-premise data center is a group of servers that you privately own and control.
                    Traditional cloud computing involves leasing data centerrecources to a third party.

        <h1>Compare physical interface and cabling types</h1>
        <div>
            <h3>Single mode fiber, multimode fiber, and copper</h3>
            <p>Single mode fiber used to tranmit on mode of light. It has a low core diameter and offers the
                longest range for high speed. The data transmissioncna be done over a long distance.
                Multimode fibre is used to transmit various modes of light.
                Copper caries and electrical pulses along its metal strands.
                It comes down to copper being cheaper in the short run but fiber optic is cheaper in the long run.
