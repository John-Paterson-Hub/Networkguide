        <h2>OSI Model</h2><br>
        <h3>(Open Systems Interconnection Model)</h3><br>
        <p>OSI Model is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system.
            Characterized computing functions into a universal set of rules and requirements in order
            to support interperability between different products and software.
                Communications between a computing system are split into seven abstract layers: Physical, Data link,
            Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.
                Created in a  time where network computing was in its infancy 1984. Though it does not
                always directly map to specific systems it can still be used to describe Network Nrchitecture.

        <h2>OSI Model 7 Layers</h2><br>
        <div>
            <h3>Physical</h3><br>
            <p>Lowest Layer of the OSI Model concerned with electrically or optically transmitted raw unstructed
                data bits accross the network from the physical layer of the sending device to the physical layer
                of the reciving device. It can be specified such as VOLTAGES, PIN LAYOUT,
                CABALING, and RADIO FREQUENCIES. At the Physical layer one might find "Physical" resources
                such as NETWORK HUBS, CABLING, REPEATERS, NETWORK ADAPTERS or MODEMS.
            </p>
        </div><br>
        <div>
            <h3>Data Link Layer</h3>
            <p>At the Data link Layer, directly connected nodes are used to perform node-to-node data transfer
                where the data is packed into frames. The Data Link layer also corrects error that might
                have occured at the physical layer.
                The data link layer encompasses two sub-layers of its own. The First sub layer
                Media Access Control (MAC), provides flow control and multiplexing for device transmission
                over a network. The second sub layer, Logical link control (LLC) provides flow and error Control
                over the physical medium as well as identifies line protocol.
            </p>
        </div><br>
        <div>
            <h3>Network Layer</h3>
            <p>The network layer is responsible for receiving frames from the data link layer, and delivering
                them to there intended destinations among based on the addresses containing inside the frame. 
                The network layer finds the destination by using local addresses such as IP (Internet Protocol).
                At this layer, routers are a crucial component used by quite literally route information where
                it needs to go between the network.
            </p>
        </div><br>
        <div>
            <h3>Transport Layer</h3>
            <p>The Transport Layer manages the delivery and error checking of data packets. It regulates
                the size, sequencing, and ultimately the transfer of data between systems and hosts.
                One of the most common examples of the transport layer is TCP  or the
                transmission control Protocal.
            </p>
        </div><br>
        <div>
            <h3>Session Layer</h3>
            <p>The Session layer controls the conversation between computers. A Session or connection
                between machines is set up, managed, and termanated at layer 5. Session layer services
                also include authentication and reconnections.
            </p>
        </div><br>
        <div>
            <h3>Presentation Layer</h3>
            <p>The presentation layer formats or translates data for the application layer based on the syntax
                or semantics that the application accepts. Because of this, it at times also called
                the syntax layer. This layer can also handle the encyption and decyption required by
                the application layer. 
            </p>
        </div><br>
        <div>
            <h3>Application Layer</h3>
            <p>At this layer, Both the end user and the application interact directly with the software application
                This layer sees network services provided to the end-user application such as web browser or office 365.
                The application layer identifies communication partners, resources, avaliablitity,
                and syncronized communication.
